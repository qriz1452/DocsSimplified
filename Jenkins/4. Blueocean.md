What is Blue Ocean?

Blue Ocean as it stands provides easy-to-use Pipeline visualization. It was intended to be a rethink of the Jenkins user experience, designed from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline. Blue Ocean was intended to reduce clutter and increases clarity for all users.

However, Blue Ocean will not receive further functionality or enhancement updates. It will only receive selective updates for significant security issues or functional defects. If you are just starting out, you can still use Blue Ocean, or you may want to consider alternative options such as the Pipeline: Stage View and Pipeline Graph View plugins. These offer some of the same functionality.

To sum up, Blue Ocean’s main features include:

    Sophisticated visualization of continuous delivery (CD) Pipelines, allowing for fast and intuitive comprehension of your Pipeline’s status.

    Pipeline editor makes the creation of Pipelines more approachable, by guiding the user through a visual process to create a Pipeline.

    Personalization to suit the role-based needs of each member of the team.

    Pinpoint precision when intervention is needed or issues arise. Blue Ocean shows where attention is needed, facilitating exception handling and increasing productivity.

    Native integration for branches and pull requests, which enables maximum developer productivity when collaborating on code in GitHub and Bitbucket.
